# NLP Repository
This repository contains Python Jupyter Notebook files covering various topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each notebook includes code examples and explanations for different NLP techniques and concepts.

# Contents
Tokenization: Demonstrates how to tokenize text into words or sentences.
Overlap Coefficient: Calculates the overlap coefficient between two strings, measuring similarity based on common characters.
Hamming Distance: Computes the Hamming distance between two strings, indicating the number of differing characters.
Regex Expressions: Examples of using regular expressions to search, match, and manipulate text patterns.
Laplace Smoothing: Implements Laplace smoothing to handle unseen words in language models.
# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
